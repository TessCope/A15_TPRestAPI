#REST API Quiz Game
This is a REST API-based quiz game developed using Java Jakarta, Hibernate, and Jersey. The application allows users to participate in quizzes by picking a question and selecting from four possible answers. Users can also create their own quizzes, choosing the difficulty level for the questions.

#Features
Quiz Participation: Users can participate in quizzes by selecting a question and choosing the correct answer from the given options.
Quiz Creation: Users can create their own quizzes by specifying the difficulty level for the questions.
Multiple Difficulty Levels: The application supports multiple difficulty levels for quizzes, allowing users to select the level that suits their preferences.
Database Persistence: The application uses Hibernate to persist the quiz questions, answers, and user data in a relational database.
RESTful API: The application follows the principles of REST and provides a set of API endpoints to interact with the quiz game.
Error Handling: The API handles errors gracefully and provides appropriate error responses for invalid requests.

#Technologies Used
